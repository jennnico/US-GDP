# US-GDP

Bar graph showing U.S. GDP (1947-2015). The user can hover over the bars to see data listed. This project was completed using JSON APIs, and D3.js. This is my first D3 project.

***Highlights:***

- d3.timeParse was used to convert strings into dates. d3.scaleTime was used to create a scale of dates on the x-axis.

- .append("title") and .text() allow the user to see the data listed when he/she hovers over a bar.
